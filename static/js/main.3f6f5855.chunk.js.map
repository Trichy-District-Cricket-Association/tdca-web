Apart from Trichy, we administered and fostered cricket in the present districts of\n                    Pudukkottai, Karur, Perambalur, Ariyalur districts (all these were part of the erstwhile Trichy\n                    district).\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    We have a robust cricketing calendar, conducting league matches, knock out tournaments, schools\n                    league for various age groups, schools knockout tournaments for various age groups, every year. Our\n                    league tournament consists of five divisions and we also have a very actively participated\n                    qualifying knock out tournament for entry into the league table. We conduct on an average about 350\n                    matches every year, apart from hosting the inter district tournaments of the TNCA in various\n                    categories.\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    The conduct of so many matches every year is due to the availability sufficient cricket grounds. We\n                    are blessed with this facility, thanks to the educational institutions and government owned\n                    entities. National institute of Technology, Saranathan college of Engineering, JJ college of\n                    engineering, National College, Ordnance Factory, RVS Institutions Southern Railway Institute, St.\n                    Joseph’s college, Bishop Heber College, Indira Ganesan College of Engineering, Vignesh Vidyalaya,\n                    Urumu Dhanalakshmi College, PABCET, BHEL, RKV grounds are some of the institutions that are helping\n                    us in no mean measure by providing grounds for the matches.\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    TDCA is a forerunner in nurturing talent at a young age, by running a cricket academy (run on a\n                    non-commercial basis) at Sowdambika AKKV School named TDCA Academy, with a team of qualified\n                    coaches. We are proud to state that we are the first in moffusil districts to form an official\n                    academy, next to the TNCA Academy at Chennai.\n                    <br />\n                    <br /> Trichy is also the only district which has a treasure of qualified umpires. We have 21\n                    umpires in the TNCA panel and 50 qualified umpires in the TDCA panel as of 2021. No other district\n                    in Tamilnadu, with the exception of Chennai city, has such a strong presence. Trichy also has the\n                    unique record of producing four BCCI qualified umpires, a feat not matched by any district. Umpiring\n                    classes for aspirants, including women, is a regular feature in our schedule of activities, Not to\n                    be left behind in one other aspect of the game, we are actively involved in enriching our stock of\n                    qualified Scorers. Regular classes are being held and this is also extended to women aspirants. We\n                    have fifteen scorers of which four are official TNCA scorers as well. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    The increasing activity in women’s cricket all over the country, has prompted us to focus on\n                    popularising and developing women’s cricket. We have drawn up an ambitious programme which will\n                    witness a remarkable growth of the game among girls and women.\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    The great visionary and doyen of mofussil cricket in Tamilnadu late Sri Rathinavelu Thevar, inspires\n                    and guides us in our quest to provide the youngsters of Trichy district, a platform for them to hone\n                    their talent in all facets of the game. While much of progress has been witnessed, there is scope\n                    for more and to that end we will strive tirelessly and relentlessly.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                </p>\n                <div className=\"aboutUsPage__container__footer\">\n                    <h3 className=\"aboutUsPage__container__footer--quote\">\n                        RESOLVE TO PERFORM WHAT YOU OUGHT; PERFORM WITHOUT FAIL WHAT YOU RESOLVE. - BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n                    </h3>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default AboutUsPage;\n","import { useState } from 'react';\nimport { auth } from '../../../../firebase';\nimport './ForgetPassword.scss';\nimport { PageRoutes } from '../../../../enums/pageRoutes';\n\nconst logo = `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/images/logo.jpg`;\nconst ForgetPassword: React.FC<any> = (): JSX.Element => {\n    const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n\n    const handlePasswordReset = async (email: string) => {\n        await auth\n            .sendPasswordResetEmail(email)\n            .then(() => {\n                window.alert('Password reset link sent!');\n            })\n            .catch((err) => {\n                console.error(err);\n                window.alert(err.message);\n            });\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <div className=\"forgetPass\">\n            <div className=\"container\">\n                <form className=\"container__form\">\n                    <img src={logo} className=\"container__form--logo\" alt=\"logo\" />\n                    <h4>Just provide your email</h4>\n                    <div className=\"container__form__formGroup\">\n                        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />\n                        <label>\n                            <br />\n                            Email\n                        </label>\n                        <span>enter your email</span>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <button className=\"container__form--loginBtn\" onClick={() => handlePasswordReset(email)}>\n                        Next\n                    </button>\n                </form>\n                {/* \n                <p>\n                    Did you remember? <a href=\"\">Sign In</a>\n                </p> */}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default ForgetPassword;\n","import firebase from 'firebase';\n\nexport default class OldMatch {\n    /** Document id of the match document. */\n    docId?: string;\n\n    oldMatchId?: string;\n\n    division?: number;\n\n    schoolMatchType?: string;\n\n    teamA?: string;\n\n    teamB?: string;\n    /**League, knockout, school matches are the possible types */\n    type?: string;\n\n    date?: Date;\n\n    venue?: string;\n\n    status?: string;\n\n    teamAScore?: string;\n\n    teamBScore?: string;\n\n    totalOvers?: number;\n\n    teamAOvers?: number;\n\n    teamBOvers?: number;\n\n    handleOldMatch({ field, value }: { field: string; value: string }): void {\n        if (field == 'oldMatchId') this.oldMatchId = value;\n\n        if (field == 'division') this.division = parseInt(value);\n        if (field == 'schoolMatchType') this.schoolMatchType = value;\n\n        if (field == 'teamA') this.teamA = value;\n        if (field == 'teamB') this.teamB = value;\n\n        if (field == 'type') this.type = value;\n        if (field == 'date') this.date = new Date(value);\n        if (field == 'venue') this.venue = value;\n\n        if (field == 'status') this.status = value;\n\n        if (field == 'teamAScore') this.teamAScore = value;\n        if (field == 'teamBScore') this.teamBScore = value;\n\n        if (field == 'totalOvers') this.totalOvers = parseInt(value);\n        if (field == 'teamAOvers') this.teamAOvers = parseInt(value);\n        if (field == 'teamBOvers') this.teamBOvers = parseInt(value);\n    }\n\n    constructor({\n        docId,\n        oldMatchId,\n        division,\n        schoolMatchType,\n        teamA,\n        teamB,\n        type,\n        date,\n        venue,\n        status,\n        teamAScore,\n        teamBScore,\n        totalOvers,\n        teamAOvers,\n        teamBOvers,\n    }: {\n        docId?: string;\n        oldMatchId?: string;\n        division?: number;\n        schoolMatchType?: string;\n        teamA?: string;\n        teamB?: string;\n        type?: string;\n        date?: Date;\n        venue?: string;\n        status?: string;\n        teamAScore?: string;\n        teamBScore?: string;\n        totalOvers?: number;\n        teamAOvers?: number;\n        teamBOvers?: number;\n    }) {\n        if (docId) this.docId = docId;\n        this.oldMatchId = oldMatchId ??
